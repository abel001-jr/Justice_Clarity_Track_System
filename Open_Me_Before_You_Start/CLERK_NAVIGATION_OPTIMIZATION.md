# Clerk Navigation Optimization

## Overview
The clerk navigation has been optimized to strictly follow the clerk workflow without duplicate handling. The navigation is now centralized in the base template and organized by the four main clerk workflows.

## Workflow-Based Navigation Structure

### 1. Dashboard
- **Overview**: Main dashboard with statistics and workflow status

### 2. Case Registration Workflow
- **Register New Case**: Create new case records
- **All Cases**: View all registered cases
- **Pending Assignment**: Cases awaiting judge assignment

### 3. Case Assignment Workflow
- **Assigned Cases**: Cases that have been assigned to judges
- **Completed Cases**: Cases that have been finalized

### 4. Hearing Coordination Workflow
- **Schedule Hearing**: Create new hearing appointments
- **All Hearings**: View all scheduled hearings
- **Today's Hearings**: View today's hearing schedule

### 5. Report Management Workflow
- **Create Report**: Generate new case reports
- **All Reports**: View all generated reports
- **Urgent Reports**: Reports requiring immediate attention

### 6. Administrative
- **Inmate Records**: Access to prison inmate information
- **Profile**: User profile management

## Navigation Flow

```
Dashboard Overview
    ↓
Case Registration → Case Assignment → Hearing Coordination → Report Management
    ↓                    ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Register Case    →  Assign Cases    →  Schedule Hearing  →  Create Report
View All Cases   →  View Assigned   →  View All Hearings →  View All Reports
Pending Cases    →  Completed Cases →  Today's Hearings  →  Urgent Reports
```

This structure ensures that clerks can efficiently navigate through their workflow without confusion or duplicate options.
